# LIQWIDS

Development of Long Island Water Quality Integrated Data System (LIQWIDS) - user interface in support of collaboration under the Long Island Nitrogen Action Plan(LINAP) using the [Water Quality Portal](https://www.waterqualitydata.us/).

### Prerequisites

This project has dependencies that require Angular CLI, Node 6.9.0  or higher, and NPM 3 or higher. NPM is downloaded with Node.js here: https://nodejs.org/en/.

Once npm is installed, install the Angular CLI:
 ```
 npm install -g @angular/cli
 ```

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Installing

Clone the repo and install it with npm
```
git clone https://github.com/USGS-WiM/LIQWIDS.git
cd /LIQWIDS
npm install
```

## Building and testing

Run live server with
```
npm run start
```
To build a production version of the app:
```
ng build --prod --base-href
```

## Deployment

GitHub Actions are in place to auto-deploy a production version of the app to our test sites.

Pushes to the `staging` branch trigger an action to build and deploy to our test site.

Pushes to the `master` branch trigger an action to build and deploy to our demo site.

## Built With

* [Angular](https://angular.io/) - The main web framework used
* [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) - Dependency Management

## Versioning

We use [SemVer](http://semver.org/) for versioning. For the versions available, see the [tags on this repository](../../tags). 

If you want to update the version numbers in the package.json and code.json:

`npm run patch` or

`npm run minor` or

`npm run major`

To reset version in those files:

`bump {version number} package.json code.json`

Advance the version when adding features, fixing bugs or making minor enhancements. Follow semver principles. To add tag in git, type `git tag v{major}.{minor}.{patch}`. Example: `git tag v2.0.5`

To push tags to remote origin: `git push origin --tags`

*Note that your alias for the remote origin may differ.
